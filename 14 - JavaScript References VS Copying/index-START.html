      // now here is the problem!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      const players6 = Array.from(players);
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      // const captain = person;
      // captain.number = 99;
      // console.log(person, captain);
      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
      console.log(person, cap2);
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const cap3 = { ...person, number: 99 };
      console.log(person, cap3);
      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
